Our goal is to democratize crypto derivatives trading, providing users of all backgrounds with a simple and efficient trading experience. For traders, we are one of the first decentralized derivative DEXs to provide portfolio margin across multiple derivative products, allowing traders to utilize & manage their collateral effectively using multiple assets like ETH, BTC, stablecoins and liquid staking tokens. For liquidity providers, we provide a simple and LP-friendly design: a stablecoin-based single-pooled liquidity design which protects LP interest via market neutrality and sustainable real yield. ",
